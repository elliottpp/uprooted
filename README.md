full stack PERN web app\n
-JWT auth login and registration
-postgres database schema is server/database.sql

how it works:
-login
-watch ad, get coins (added to user through users table)
-go to shop and spend coins on trees (trees are fetched from main trees table)
-tree is added to user_trees database
-dashboard loads all user's trees from user_trees database

all databases should be normalised (in 3NF form?)
-uprooted team :)
